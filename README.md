# 10. Object-Oriented Programming Challenge: Team Profile Generator

# Purpose
This Node.js command line application prompts for information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays a roster with summaries for each position, including the name, ID, and email. Depending on the employer role of manager, engineer(s), and intern(s), it will also display the office number, GitHub profile, or school, respectively.

When the user clicks on the email address in the HTML, the default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address. The GitHub username also links to the team member's GitHub profile in a separate tab when clicked.

In the future, this project may be refactored for improved efficiency and readability.
